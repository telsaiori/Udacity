My first goal, ofcourse is to become a programmer. I had learned computer science when I was a student 
but I'm not interesting programming at that time and that was 10 years ago.

Now, I need to learn the programming all over again. I hope I can find a programming job 6 month after.

BTW, I'm not a native English speaker so there might be some wrong with my English.
