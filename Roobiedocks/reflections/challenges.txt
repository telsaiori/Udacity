I always wondering if I can really become a programmer. I have a lot of friend who is a programmer but they seems diffrenet with me.
I mean, they like to code when they are a teenager(or maybe even earlier) and seems they also has talent for programming.

I also wondering it will take how long to learn so I can use ruby(or rails) to find a job.
